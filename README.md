# MAGD150

Lab 1:
This was my first lab of the year. We made a sketch of something related to space in grayscale. I drew an alien head.

Lab 2:
In this lab, we created a sketch of something related to balloons and the drawing had to be in color. I drew a stick figure dude holding a balloon.

Lab 3:
This assignment's theme was bubbles. It focused on mouse and key press functions, math, and floats and ints. I made a sketch where, when started, bubbles rose from the bottom of the screen and when the user pressed the mouse, it put a bubble of a random color in the spot the user clicked.

Lab 4: 
This assignment's theme was bouncing balls. It focused on if-else and while loops. I made a sketch where a ball was bouncing vertically. Every time the ball touched the edge of the screen, it would bounce back the other way. When the user clicked the mouse after the ball hit the top, the speed of the ball would increase. When the user clicked the mouse after the ball hit the bottom, the speed of the ball would decrease.

Lab 5:
This assignment's theme was "menu to an alternate dimension. It focused on buttons. In my sketch, if the user clicked and held the mouse on the rectangular button, the sketch would change to "an alternate dimension" by showing my 4th project with the bouncing balls theme. Letting go of the mouse would return the user to the menu. If the user clicked and held the mouse on the ciruclar button, the skecth would change to another "alternate dimension" by showing my first project with the outer space theme. Letting go of the mouse would return the user to the menu.
